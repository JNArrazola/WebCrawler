# IMDB Web Crawler
`IMDB Web Crawler` is a web spider programmed in Java that extracts the `title`, `rating`, `synopsis`, and `actors` from movies by scraping information from the famous **IMDB movie website**. Starting from an initial movie, the spider recursively goes through the actors profiles, finds more movies, and extracts additional information.
